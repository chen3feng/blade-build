Given the map of related targets, i.e., the subset of target_database
that are dependencies of those targets speicifed in Blade command
line, this utility class expands the 'deps' property of each target
to be all direct and indirect dependencies of that target.

After expanded the dependencies of targets, sort the topologically
and then provide the query interface to users by blade manager.
