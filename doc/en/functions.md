# Build Functions #

Some Functions can be called in BUILD files.

## glob ##

```python
glob(include, exclude=[], allow_empty=False)
```

Glob is a helper function that finds all files that match certain path patterns in the source dir, and returns a list of their paths.
Patterns may contain shell-like wildcards, such as * , ? , or [charset]. Additionally, the path element '**' matches any subpath.
You can use `exclude` to exclude some files.

Example:

```python
...
    srcs = glob(['*.java', 'src/main/java/**/*.java'], exclude=['*Test.java'])
...
```

Usually, it is an error for glob to return an empty result, but you can specify `allow_empty=True` to eliminate this error if it is surely you expected.
