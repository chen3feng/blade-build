# Build Lex and Yacc

## lex_yacc_library
Used to describe a lex yacc target, generate a scanner and a grammer for a compiler.

Lex and yacc are often be used together. when we compile a lex file, `yy.tab.h` is needed which is
generated by yacc. but when we compile `yy.tab.cc` which is generated from the yacc file. it call
the `parse` function which is generated by lex.

If we saparate them into 2 libraries, there will depends on each other, there is a loop dependency.

So we build the in one rule, the srcs must be a tuple of 2 elements, which are the lex and yacc file.
the suffix should be `l` and `y` for C code, and should be `ll` and `yy` for c++ result.

This rule will generate a library and a header file.

```python
lex_yacc_library(
     name = 'parser',
     srcs = [
         'line_parser.ll',
         'line_parser.yy'
     ],
     deps = [
         ":xcubetools",
     ],
     recursive = True
)
```

Attributes:
- recursive=True Generate resursice C scannerã€‚

lex_yacc_library also support most cc_library attributes.
