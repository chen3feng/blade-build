# Command Line Reference

## Basic Command Line Syntax

```bash
Blade <subcommand> [options]... [target patterns]...
```

## Subcommand

Subcommand is a subcommand that currently has:

* `build` Build specified targets
* `test`  Build and run tests
* `clean` Cleanup specified targets
* `dump`  Dump some useful information
* `query` Query target dependencies
* `run`   Build and run a single executable target

## Target Pattern

Target pattern list is a spaces separated list.

Target pattern is allowed in command line, some configuration items and target attributes.

Target pattern supported formats:

* `path:name` represents a target in the path
* `path:*` indicates all targets in the path
* `path` same as above
* `path/...` represents all targets in the path, and recursively includes all subdirectories
* `:name` indicates a target in the current directory

If path starts with `//`, it means it is a full path starts from the root of the [workspace](workspace.md).

If no target is specified, it defaults to all targets in the current directory (excluding subdirectories). If there is no BUILD file in the current directory, it will fail.
When you specify ... as the end target, if its path exists, it will not fail even if the expansion is empty.

Blade will search `BUILD` files recursively for the `...` target pattern, if some dirs should be
excluded from searching, you can put an empty `.bladeskip` under it.

## Subcommand Options

The options supported by different subcommands are different. Please run blade \<subcommand\> --help to view

Here are some common command line options

* `-m32,-m64` specifies the number of build target digits, the default is automatic detection
* `-p PROFILE` specifies `debug`/`release`, default is `release`
* `-k`, `--keep-going` encountered an error during the build process to continue execution (if it is a fatal error can not continue)
* `-j N`, `--jobs=N` N way parallel build (Blade defaults to parallel build, calculate the appropriate value by yourself)
* `-t N`, `--test-jobs=N` N-way parallel test, applicable on multi-CPU machines
* `--verbose` complete command output for each command line
* `â€“h`, `--help` show help
* `--color=yes/no/auto` Whether to turn on color
* `--exclude-targets` Comma separated target patterns, to be excluded from loading.
* `--generate-dynamic` Forces the generation of dynamic libraries
* `--generate-java` generates java files for proto_library and swig_library
* `--generate-php` generates php files for proto_library and swig_library
* `--gprof` supports GNU gprof
* `--coverage` supports generation of coverage and currently supports GNU gcov and Java jacoco

## Example

```bash
# Build all targets in the current directory, not including subdirectories
blade build

# Build all the targets in the current directory and subdirectories
blade build ...

# Build a target named `urllib` in the current directory
blade build :urllib

# Build all targets under the `app` direcotry, exclude its `sub` subdirectory
blade build app... --exclude-targets=app/sub...

# Build and test all targets from the WORKPACE root, common and all its subdirectories

blade test //common/...
blade test base/...

# Build and test the target named `string_test` in the base subdirectory
blade test base:string_test
```
