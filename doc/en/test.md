# Testing support

Blade provides complete support for test-driven development, and can run multiple test programs automatically through command line.

## incremental test
Blade test supports incremental testing defaultly to speed up the execution of tests.

Tests that have already been PASSED do not need to run again in the next build and test unless:

* Any dependency changes to tests cause it to regenerate.
* Tests dependent test data changes, this dependency is explicitly dependent, the user needs to specify using a BUILD file, such as testdata.
* Tests where the environment variable has changed.
* Test arguments change.
* Fail's test cases will always be rerun.

## Full test

If you need to run the full test, use the --full-test option, such as blade test common/... --full-test, all tests will be run unconditionly.
In addition, cc_test supports the `always_run` attribute, which is used to always run every time during incremental testing, regardless of the last execution result.
```python
cc_test(
    name = 'zookeeper_test',
    srcs = 'zookeeper_test.cc',
    always_run = True
)
```

## Concurrent testing

Blade test supports concurrent testing. The concurrent test runs the test that need to be run after build.
You can use `-t` (or `--test-jobs N`) to set the number of concurrent tests. Blade will execute max N test processes concurrently.

Example:
```bash
blade test //common... --test-jobs 8
```

## Non-concurrent testing
For some tests that may not run in concurrent because they may interfere with each other, you can add the `exclusive` attribute.
```python
cc_test(
    name = 'zookeeper_test',
    srcs = 'zookeeper_test.cc',
    exclusive = True
)
```

## Test coverage
When building and running tests, with the --coverage parameter, the blade will include coverage-related compile options, currently only for C++ and Java.

C/C++ test coverage is implemented by gcc's [gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html). After the test is run, you need to execute a third-party tool such as gcov or lcov to generate a test coverage report.

To generate java test coverage, you need to download and unzip a [jacoco](https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/) releases build, and configure it correctly:
```python
java_test(
    ...
    jacoco_home = 'path/to/jacoco',
    ...
)
```
The java test coverage report will be generated into the `java_coverage_report` dir under the build dir.

## Skip specified tests
Blade supports explicitly skipping specified tests with the `--skip-tests parameter`, which is useful when you need to run a large number of tests in batches and expect to skip some tests. E.g:
```bash
blade test base/... --skip-tests=base/string,base/encoding:hex_test
```
Indicates to run all tests in the base directory, but skip all tests under `base/string` and `base/encoding:hex_test`.
