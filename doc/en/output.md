# Blade's Output #

## Terminal Display ##

The construction process is color-highlighted, and the error message is colored, which is convenient for positioning errors. Unless the command is in error, the information executed by the command is not scrolled, which helps to reduce the amount of screen output.

The output also write to the `blade-bin/blade.log` file.

## Generated Files ##

By default, the native arch executable is generated, and it is easy to specify 32/64-bit results, plus -m32/64.
The result of the release version is generated by default. If you generate a debug version, add -p debug.
By default, the current directory is built. If the external modules that the current directory depends on need to be rebuilt, they will be built together (Make is difficult to do).
If you want to build the target of all subdirectories from the current directory, it is also very simple: blade...

## Building results and source code separation ##

The results of the different build options are placed in different directories, and the generated files are placed in this directory at the same level, without contaminating the source code directory.

## Clean up build results ##

To clear the build results (generally not needed), just run the `blade clean` command.
