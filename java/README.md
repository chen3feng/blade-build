ReportGenerator.java is used to generate java code coverage report by use of JaCoCo API.
java_report_generator.jar is the package of class files compiled from ReportGenerator.java
by the following command:
```bash
javac -encoding utf-8 -classpath JACOCO_HOME/lib/jacocoant.jar -d classes_dir ReportGenerator.java
```
Alternatively, you could use the BUILD file below. Remember to add a prebuilt java_library
target for jacocoant.jar as the dependency. Provided that JACOCO_HOME is thirdparty/jacoco:

BUILD:
```python
java_library(
    name = 'report_generator',
    srcs = 'ReportGenerator.java',
    deps = '//thirdparty/jacoco:jacoco',
)
```

WORKSPACE/thirdparty/jacoco/BUILD:
```python
java_library(
    name = 'jacoco',
    prebuilt = True,
    binary_jar = 'lib/jacocoant.jar',
)
```    

The generated jar is report_generator.jar in the build output directory and then you could
rename or copy it somewhere and set the corresponding configuration in BLADE_ROOT.
